# Food Management System. 
Hi all.
Here I have created a iOS mobile app project about food management system. This project is very helpful to any institution like
office, school, college, university etc.
* Here I have used swift 5.1 , platform Xcode 11.1 and **realm** local database.
* Basically this app has 6 UI View 

1. Log in UI View
2. Registration UI View
3. Admin UI View
4. Staff/User UI View
5. User order list UI View 
6. User amount UI View
### I uploaded all UI views images in following for better understanding

* Both registered user/staff ar sign in their valid user id and and password in log in view page.
* In registration, page a user and admin put their valid information (name, id, password, and staff or admin role)
* In admin UI page, the admin can add food item and price , show users/staffs amount and their order list
* In staff/user UI page, an user can see the item which are given by admin. An user also see his/her amount list in current month
